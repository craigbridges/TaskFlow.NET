Research:
- Async
- ANN
- Decision Trees
- Think of more example jobs/utilities (including some with AI components) and put into spreadsheet

Design:
- Filter everything against a user
- Learning
- Finish conversations
	- Feedback loop for non recognised inputs (break down users input and ask what intent was for each part)
	- Alternative query engine if no result found (e.g. Google)
	- https://developers.google.com/actions/reference/v1/conversation
	- https://developers.google.com/actions/reference/v1/action-package
- Cloud
	- Ability to communicate with other instances of Netbot (against same user) or other computers (e.g. via remote desktop) to run commands/utilities/jobs. If other device not on-line/on then it could be scheduled on 'the cloud' (e.g. on-line) and synced when other device is switched on or taken on-line.

Implementation:
- Create solution and start structuring code base
- Choose Open Source license
- Add to public GitHub repository
